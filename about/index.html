            <h2>Where am I?</h2>
            <p>
            Welcome to seest, a tool for practicing your estimates on the time needed to finish an
            activity. It provides input for an estimate, a timer to measure the actual time taken,
            and the comparison between the two.

            <h2>Why bother?</h2>
            <p>
            Because your time is a limited resource and schedules can increase efficiency. A common
            mistake, however, is to make a schedule based on what you want to do and not what you
            can do. If your body needs 10 minutes to jog 1 mile, no amount of time management is
            going to let you finish 1 mile in 1 minute. To figure out reasonable time slots, you
            will need to accurately estimate how long it takes to do things.

            <h2>How do I Use this?</h2>

            <h3>Form</h3>
            <p>
            The form contains an activity and estimate field. The activity is an optional reminder
            for what you are estimating. The estimate is your guess at how long it will take to
            finish the activity. It follows a special format #h#m#s where #h is the hours, #m is
            the minutes, #s is the seconds, and # is a non-negative whole number. You can leave out
            a unit (e.g. 1h30m) and you can go over 60 seconds or minutes (e.g. 90m).  Once you're
            ready press the “Start” button to begin the timer.
            </p>

            <h3>Timer</h3>
            <p>
            The timer page lists your activity and estimate, along with a timer of how long it has
            been since you started. The timer and estimate are read as Hours:Minutes:Seconds. When
            you're done with your task, press the “Finish” button to see the results.
            </p>

            <h3>Results</h3>
            <p>
            The results page is a summary of your session. In particular you will want to pay
            attention to the error and difference so you can make adjustments for future estimates.
            The estimate, duration, and difference are read as Hours:Minutes:Seconds.
            </p>
            <dl>
                <dt>Error</dt>
                <dd>
                    The percentage the estimate is off by, relative to the duration.
                    <br>
                    The estimate is more/less than ###% of the actual time.
                    <br>
                    <var>Error</var> = (<var>estimate</var> - <var>duration</var>) &divide;
                    <var>duration</var> &times; 100
                </dd>
                <dt>Estimate</dt> <dd>Amount of time estimated for the activity </dd>
                <dt>Duration</dt> <dd>Amount of time the activity took</dd>
                <dt>Difference</dt>
                <dd>
                    Amount of time the estimate is off by.
                    <br>
                    The estimate is more/less than the actual time by ##:##:##.
                    <br>
                    <var>Difference</var> = <var>estimate</var> &minus; <var>duration</var>
                </dd>
                <dt>Started</dt> <dd>When the timer started</dd>
                <dt>Ended</dt> <dd>When the timer ended</dd>
            </dl>
            <p>
            In case you are repeating activities, the “New” button will send you back to the form
            with the same values already filled in.
            </p>

            <h3>Notes</h3>
            <p>
            Except for the form page, your session information is saved as part of the URL so you
            can send it or sync it with your other devices. You can also bookmark pages if you want
            to revisit them later or you want to close the browser. If you are confident you will
            not clear your history, you can just simply close it and open it back from history
            instead.
            </p>
            <p>
            If you wish to have a link to the form with its fields automatically filled in, first
            fill in the form, start the timer, immediately end the timer, and use the “New” button
            from the results page. The URL of the current form page will have the values you
            entered from the beginning.
            </p>
            <p>
            seest uses the clock of the current device to record times and update the timer. For it
            to be accurate, the time offset on devices used must be the same. That is, if you
            started the timer on a device with its time set 10 minutes ahead, then the timer will
            only be correct if used on other devices that are also set 10 minutes ahead. This does
            not apply to time zones and it can be used freely between different ones. However, the
            result page will always display the start and end times according to the timezone of
            the current device.

            <h2>What browsers?</h2>
            <p>
            seest will generally work in browsers that support HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript. Since
            this is a small hobby project, it will only be guaranteed to work in a limited amount
            of browsers and only their latest stable version. Currently they are: Chrome, Firefox,
            and Opera. Accommodations may be made for other browsers but user experience and
            functionality is only ensured for those mentioned earlier.

            <h2>Any tips?</h2>

            <h3>Plan your activity</h3>
            <p>
            Be specific about what you are doing and what your goals are. The process of defining
            the activity in greater detail encourages further visualization of the situation, which
            will help you identify any aspects that may have been overlooked. In addition, it will
            be painfully obvious when you have been distracted and start working off tangent.
            </p>

            <h3>Know what you want</h3>
            <p>
            Have concrete conditions for being done. For some activities this may be trivial but
            for others, where there is no finished state, more work can always go in because it can
            always be made better. Without knowing beforehand what you want, it will be hard to
            predict when you will want to stop.
            </p>

            <h3>Don't get distracted</h3>
            <p>
            The timer does not have a pause button for a reason. If you get distracted or
            interrupted, nothing changes the fact that you are not done with what you planned to
            do. However, it is understandable if something urgent comes up and stops you from
            being able to continue. It is up to you to decide if such interruptions are normal and
            whether they should be considered in future plans.
